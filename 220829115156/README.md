# Makefile: Automatic Variables

From Managing Projects with GnU Make:

> Automatic variables are set by make after a rule is matched. They provide access to elements from the target and prerequisite lists so you donâ€™t have to explicitly specify any filenames. They are very useful for avoiding code duplication, but are critical when defining more general pattern rules.

* $@ evaluates to the target of the rule
* $< evauates to the first prerequisites
* $^ evaluates to the list of prerequisites

```make
NAME := megaphone

CC := c++
CFLAGS := -Wall -Werror -Wextra -std=c++98

SRCS := megaphone.cpp
OBJS := $(SRCS:%.cpp=%.o)

all: $(SRCS)
	make $(NAME)

$(NAME): $(OBJS)
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $^ -o $@

%.o: %.cpp
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $< -o $@

.PHONY: all
```
