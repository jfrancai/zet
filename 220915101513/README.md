# About Floating Point Numbers

> Accuracy and precision are two concepts in measurement that nicely capture the different properties of ints and floats (on any system, independent of the particular floating point representation used). "Accuracy" refers to how close a measurement is to the true value, whereas "precision" has to do with how much information you have about a quantity, how uniquely you have it pinned down.

Integer are accurate but unprecise wherease floatting point numbers are precise but unaccurate.
