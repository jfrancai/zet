# Inheritance

> Classes in C++ can be extended, creating new classes which retain characteristics of the base class. This process, known as inheritance, involves a base class and a derived class: The derived class inherits the members of the base class, on top of which it can add its own members.

```cpp
class derived_class_name: public base_class_name
{
	/*...*/
};
```

> ``public`` access specifier may be replaced by any one of the other access specifiers ``protected`` or ``private``. It denotes the most accessible level the members inherited from the class that follows it will have from the derived class.
