# Dockerfile and Docker Image

* The Dockerfile is a configuration file that automates the steps of creating a Docker image.
* It is similar to a Makefile.
* Docker reads instructions from the Dockerfile to automate the steps otherwise performed manually to create an image.
* To build an image, create a file called Dockerfile.
* The Dockerfile describes the steps taken to assemble the image.
* When the Dockerfile  has  been created, call the docker build command, using the path of directory that contains Dockerfile as the argument.
