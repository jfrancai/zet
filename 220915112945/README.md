# Operator Overloading

From [sbi](https://stackoverflow.com/users/140719/sbi):

1. Whenever the meaning of an operator is not obviously clear and undisputed, it should not be overloaded.
2. Always stick to the operatorâ€™s well-known semantics.
3. Always provide all out of a set of related operations.

Do not use operator overloading.
