# All The Important Short Cut You Have To Know

## Intro

There is no right answer on how to use shortcuts and when to use them, but not using them is so sad :(

I think you shouldn't have to focus on rote learning them, but rather take what bothers you most in your daily routine and try to figure out if there's a shortcut that can solve your problem. Once you find it, practice it until it's natural for you to use it and move on to the next one :)

## Browser

* ctrl + T : open a new tab
* ctrl + W : close the current tab
* ctrl + L : Jump to the address bar
* ctrl + backspace : delete a word
* And many more...
