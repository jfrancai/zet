# TypeScript: A Static Type Checker

* TS is a super set of JS.

* Detecting errors in code without running it is referred
to as static checking. Determining what's an error and what's not based on the kinds
of values being operated on is known as static type checking.

* Remember : TypeScript is JavaSript's runtime with a compile-time type checker.
