## What is a container

 Containers are isolated groups of processes running on a single host, which fulfill a set of “common” features.

* chroot, namespaces, cgroups

* Kernel Space
* Container Runtimes
* Container Images

> Why to use containers ?

Containers are similar to VMs, but they have relaxed isolation properties to share the Operating System (OS) among the applications.
