# Deep Learning : Intro

* Machine learning : neural network (brain inspired)

* Neuron : something that hold a number

* Human visual cortex

* Learning

* Hidden layers

* Activation of a layer

* Image recognition

Waited sum
```
sig(w1 a1 + w2 a2 + ... + wn an - bias)
```
> We want to find the params that are going to recognize certain shape in an image. Those param are random at first and need to be found.

- Weights
- [Sigmoid funcion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function) : get a value between 0 and 1.
- Bias : how high the waited sum needs to be before the neuron gets activated

> Each neuron of each layer has its own weights and bias.
