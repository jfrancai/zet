# Multiple inheritance

> A class may inherit from more than one class by simply specifying more base classes, separated by commas, in the list of a class's base classes (i.e., after the colon).

```cpp
class Rectangle: public Polygon, public Output;
class Triangle: public Polygon, public Output;
```
